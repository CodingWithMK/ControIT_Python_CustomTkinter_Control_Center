Hello lovely GitHub Community,

In this repository I want to share my all first Modern Graphical User Interface project written in Python using the CustomTkinter GUI module following by some other modules and libraries like psutil, keyboard and so on. This project contains stuff for a basic computer control center and some exclusive cool stuff like a keyboard input blocker which will be a genius solution for many hardcore users to clean their keyboards without shutting down their PC's.

This project will be updated by every change and feature inclusion until I have no ideas remaining. Stay tuned, give me feedback and share this with your friends.

Thank You!

NOTE:
For those, who want to run and test the applications, have to download the 'requirements.txt' dependency file to install the required libraries and modules of Python to run the code of these applications on your computer. For sure you also have to install Python on your computer. 
Firstly to avoid any problems by trying to install the value of the 'requirements.txt' file, install pipenv over the command prompt as Administrator by using the command 'pip install pipenv'. After that if you have downloaded the 'requirements.txt' file into your downloads directrory then use the command 'cd Downloads' in command prompt as Administrator and then after clicking enter key run the command 'pip install requirements.txt'. Now python pacakge installer will install all required libraries and modules on your computer and you can run the applications without any problems.

Enjoy it!
