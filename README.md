Hello lovely GitHub Community,

In this repository I want to share my all first Modern Graphical User Interface project written in Python using the CustomTkinter GUI module following by some other modules and libraries like psutil, keyboard and so on. This project contains stuff for a basic computer control center and some exclusive cool stuff like a keyboard input blocker which will be a genius solution for many hardcore users to clean their keyboards without shutting down their PC's.

This project will be updated by every change and feature inclusion until I have no ideas remaining. Stay tuned, give me feedback and share this with your friends.

Thank You!
